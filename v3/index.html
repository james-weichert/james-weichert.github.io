        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is James and I'm a senior at UC Berkeley studying computer science and data science. I'm passionate about human-centered and ethical technology and am interested in the intersection of public policy, governance, data, design, and computers. In my spare time, I dabble in programming, data science, graphic design, policy advocacy, and a little bit of cooking.</p>

        <p>I'm currently a lead GSI (TA) for <a href="http://data8.org/fa22/">Data 8</a>: Foundations of Data Science, UC Berkeley's introductory data science class (with over 2,000 students for Fall 2022). Over the summer, I was the instructor for <a href="https://data6.org/su22/">Data 6</a>, a data science class intended for students without any prior coding or statistics experience.</p>

        <p>This year, I will be finishing up a double major in computer science and data science with a minor in public policy. As part of the UC Berkeley Data Science Honors Program, I am researching bias and explainability in algorithms and artificial intelligence. After graduation, I am looking to get my master's in computer science before starting my career in data science, machine learning, and public policy.</p>

        <h2>Teaching</h2>
        <p>My favorite part of studying CS and data science at Berkeley has been the opportunity to get taught by other undergraduate students, and in turn to teach other students myself.</p>

        <p>I took Data 8: Foundations of Data Science my first semester at Cal and instantly fell in love with the class. I then volunteered as a "Lab Assistant" for two semesters before becoming a tutor and eventually an undergraduate student instructor (uGSI)—the Berkeley equivalent of a TA—in spring 2022. Currently, I have been on Data 8 course staff for five semesters, and am now a lead GSI responsible for content development and maintenance.</p>

        <p>In summer 2022, I had the opportunity to teach Data 6, a relatively new Berkeley data science class for students without prior coding experience. As the instructor for the course, I was responsible developing and delivering content to a class of 60 students, managing assignments and course policies, and leading a six-person course staff. Over 80% of students—half of whom had no prior coding experience—achieved grades in the A+/A/A- range. </p>

        <h2>Advocacy</h2>
        <p>A large amount of my time outside of the classroom at Berkeley has been spent on student advocacy in positions in Berkeley's undergraduate student government (the ASUC) and the University of California Student Association (UCSA). My advocacy tends to focus on equitable academic policies, college affordability and access, and long-term financial and academic planning for a post-pandemic university.</p>
