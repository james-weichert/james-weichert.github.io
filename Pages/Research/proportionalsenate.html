						<p>As part of a project for the <em>Berkeley Political Review</em>, I explored the political ramifications of making the U.S. Senate more proportionally-representative by allocating Senate seats by population (as is done with seats in the House of Representatives). I produced a hypothetical map (shown here) where seats were apportioned according a state's population in an effort to reduce the disparity in the population per Senate seat across all states. As expected, the result of allocating senators according to population–and not on an equal basis as described in the Constitution–is that political capital (the power of any one citizen to influence national policy) is more or less standardized across the country. While this method is far from perfect, this algorithm represents a step in the right direction towards the democratization of the Senate. The image pictured above imagines a hypothetical Senate election using this new redistribution of Senate seats. This model in particular allows the minority party in some states (e.g. California, Texas, New York, Georgia, etc.) to have some Senate representation.</p>
