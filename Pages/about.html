					<h3 class="orange_text">Hi, I'm James.</h3>

					<p>I'm a freshman at the University of California, Berkeley studying Computer Science and Data Science with a minor in Public Policy. I'm interested in the intersection of public policy, governance, data, design, and software.</p>

					<p>Early on, I discovered my love for designing and creating products and digital experiences. I've strengthened my skills by developing applications and programs in various programming languages with an emphasis on Front-End Web Development.</p>

					<p>Coming from a Do-It-Yourself and Learn-It-Yourself background, my programming style combines industry standards with a general understanding of computer science and design, along with my own set of tricks, shortcuts and workarounds. Particularly, my work focuses on finding the intersections between technology and everyday life, whether through applications, physical products, or a particular design protocol.</p>

					<p>Nowadays, I find myself eager to learn a new programming language or discover a new design convention. And while it may not always be easy to find the time to create new digital experiences with my busy schedule, I try to seize every opportunity to use my skills to elevate my life and the lives of others.</p>
