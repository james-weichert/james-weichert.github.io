        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is James. I'm a current Computer Science MS student at Virginia Tech focusing on 
          explainable AI and algorithmic fairness. I graduated from UC Berkeley in May 2023 with majors in computer science and data science
          and a minor in public policy. I'm passionate about human-centered and ethical technology and am interested in the 
          intersection of public policy, governance, data, and technology. In my spare time, I dabble in programming, 
          data science, graphic design, policy advocacy, and a little bit of cooking.</p>

          <p>During my time at both UC Berkeley and Virginia Tech, I've been engaged in the classroom as a TA and instructor.
            In summer 2022 and 2023, I was the course instructor for <a href="https://data6.org/"></a>Data 6: Introduction to Computational Thinking with Data, 
            an introductory data science class at UC Berkeley intended for students without prior coding experience.

            As an undergraduate, I was a lead GSI (TA) for <a href="https://data8.org/">Data 8</a>: Foundations of Data Science, 
            UC Berkeley's introductory data science class (with over 2,000 students in Fall 2022).

            I am currently a Graduate TA for <a href="https://cs.vt.edu/Undergraduate/courses/CS1114.html">CS 1114</a>: Introduction to Software Design at Virginia Tech.
          </p>

        <h2>Teaching</h2>
        <p>My favorite part of studying CS and data science at Berkeley was the opportunity to get taught by other undergraduate students, and in turn to teach other students myself.</p>

        <p>I took Data 8: <em>Foundations of Data Science</em> my first semester at Cal and instantly fell in love with the class. 
          I then volunteered as a "Lab Assistant" for two semesters before becoming a tutor and eventually an undergraduate student instructor (uGSI)—the Berkeley equivalent of a TA—in spring 2022. 
          I served on Data 8 course staff for six semesters, and was the lead GSI responsible for content development and maintenance for the 2022-2023 academic year.</p>

        <p>In summer 2022, I had the opportunity to teach Data 6, a relatively new Berkeley data science class for students without prior coding experience. 
          As the instructor for the course, I was responsible developing and delivering content to a class of 60 students, managing assignments and course policies, and leading a six-person course staff. 
          Over 80% of students—half of whom had no prior coding experience—achieved grades in the A+/A/A- range. I was grateful to be able to teach Data 6 again in Summer 2023.</p>

        <p>A large amount of my time outside of the classroom at Berkeley was spent on student advocacy through positions in Berkeley's undergraduate student government (the ASUC) and the University of California Student Association (UCSA).
