                        <p>Carnitas (literally meaning "little pieces of meat") are made by simmering pork its own fat, and are a must-have when I make tacos. Making carnitas from scratch is not a quick process, but it is worth the wait. 
                            I cut a whole pork shoulder into pieces and <strong>braise the meat for two hours in lard with onion, orange, coca cola, condensed milk, garlic, oregano, bay leaf, and cumin</strong> (along the lines of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEZioC-qMd4&t=102s" target="_blank" class="g-link">this example</a>). 
                            If you desire crispiness, sear the pork after braising and before shredding.</p>
                        <p><strong class="tip g">Tip!</strong> 
                            Save your leftover carnitas (if there are any left) to make quesadillas for lunch!

                            I took the ferry over to Bainbridge Island for an easy and stress-free Saturday day trip. The ferry is very pedestrian-friendly and downtown Bainbridge (Winslow) is only a five minute walk from the ferry terminal! While there, I had good <strong>al pastor tacos at Bainbridge Tacos</strong>.

                            I first had Pad Kra Pao—stir fried minced chicken with chillies and Thai basil—when I visited Bangkok in March 2025 (I was reliably told that this, and not pad thai, was the true national dish of Thailand).
                            I recently discovered it's surprisingly easy to make, provided you can get your hands on some niche ingredients.
                            Stir fry <strong>shallots, bird's eye chillies, ground chicken, Thai basil, green beans, sugar, oyster sauce, fish sauce, and (the secret ingredient) <a href="https://www.hmart.com/seasoning-sauce-20oz/p" target="_blank" class="b-link">Golden Mountain sauce</a></strong>.

                            You can find Thai chilies, Thai basil, and Golden Mountain sauce at H Mart or your neighborhood Asian grocery store.

                        <p>A well-made bánh mì is probably my favorite sandwich ever, so I'm very happy to finally be able to make a good one at home. 
                            I make grilled lemongrass pork (thịt nướng) from pieces of pork shoulder and a <strong>marinade of fish sauce, soy sauce, and brown sugar in a 3:3:2 ratio</strong>, 
                            plus garlic and lemongrass (paste). If you have access to a grill, this is the time to use it! 
                            (And don't forget the <strong>pickled carrots and daikon!</strong>)</p>
                        <p><strong class="tip r">Tip!</strong> 
                            The <strong>"Parisien" baguette at <a href="https://lepanier.com/" target="_blank" class="r-link">Le Panier</a></strong> in Pike Place is the perfect combination of crispy and fluffy, 
                            making it well-suited for a bánh mì.</p>

                        <p>If you don't want to go through the (admittedly time-consuming) process of making your own bánh mì, I'd recommend <strong><a href="https://cracklemi.com/" target="_blank" class="r-link">Crackle Mi</a></strong>, with locations in Ballard and Fremont.
                            The grilled pork bánh mì was <strong>only $10 and had a very generous portion of meat</strong>.
                            Their fresh spring rolls are also great!

                        <p>Bò lúc lắc ("shaking beef") is a tasty dish that is less common on menus at Vietnamese restaurants in the U.S., but is surprisingly easy to make. 
                            With leftover pork from making bánh mì, I made a <strong>marinade with oyster sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and salt</strong>. 
                            Sear the pork pieces on medium-high before resting, then soften the <strong>onions and bell</strong> peppers in the same skillet (you still want some firmness).
